Assignments
1. FizzBuzz
Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5.


2. Chess Board
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using new- line characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a “#” character. The characters should form a chess board.
